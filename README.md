# FluxHist
ANNIE Flux plots for CC and NC XS.

Will output Flux histogram plot as well as a root file with histograms for each flavor that can be used in combination with the GENIE XS spline files to calculate predicted cross sections from GENIEv3.

Note the spline files are in energy bins of 50 MeV. Therefore the default histogram binning here is recommended for 50 MeV. Modify the configurations (start of the code) accordingly. The default units are [neutrinos / 50 MeV / cm^2 / POT]; these units can be modified within the code.

Some example plots are given with varying units.

### Configuration
(Modify in `FluxRates.py` header)
```
plot_name = 'example.png'        # name of output Flux Histogram plot
generate_rootfile = False        # generate an output root file with flux histograms for each flavor
rootfile_name = 'example.root'   # name of the output root file
generate_summary_txt = True      # generate a summary txt with flux statistics
txt_name = 'example.txt'         # name of the output txt file
Full_Volume = True               # whether to use full detector (True) volume or a reduced, FV (False) --> if False, FV is defined below (centered at (0,0,0), geometry assumed to be cylindrical)
FV_radius = 1                    # FV radius [m]
FV_half_z = 1.5                  # FV half-height [m]
TEST_RUN = True                  # will only run over 20 gsimple files (used for fast debugging and testing)
bin_size = 0.05                  # Histogram energy bin size [GeV] -> default = 0.05, corresponds to the 50 MeV bins we want for comparison to GENIE XS spline files
upper_hist_limit = 10            # largest bin [GeV] -> default = 10, corresponds to maximum value in the GENIE XS spline files
hist_y_label = r'$\Phi (\nu)$' + ' / 50MeV / cm' + r'$^2$' + ' / POT'   # default scaling for histogram [neut / cm^2 / 50MeV / POT]
upper_plot_limit = 5             # upper energy limit [MeV] displayed in plot image (default = 5)
gsimple_directory = 'filepath/'  # path for the gsimple flux files
```

### Usage
`python3 FluxRates.py`

### Output
1. `root` file with the flux histograms per flavor
2. Printed flux statistics
3. Output txt file with flux statistics
